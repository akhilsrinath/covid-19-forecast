# covid-19-forecast

The coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting 163 countries and territories around the world. The trajectory of the disease has been similar in many countries, but China and Italy have been particularly hard hit with over 5,000 deaths, while Japan and some other East Asian countries have seen a slower spread. However, the fact that some countries test more than others, and with different approaches, means that these statistics may under-represent the true spread of the disease for some places. Medical professionals are working tirelessly to help attenuate the severity of this disease. 

In this project, I attempt to forecast the spread of this disease country-wise.
